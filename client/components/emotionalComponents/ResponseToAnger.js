      <p>Anger is a normal and even healthy emotion â€” but it's important to deal with it in a positive way. Uncontrolled anger can hurt your health and your friendships.</p>
      <h4>Here are some positive ways to deal with anger:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Think before you speak:</b> In the heat of the moment, it's easy to say something you'll later regret. Take a few moments to collect your thoughts before saying anything.
        </li>
        <li><b>Once you're calm, express your anger:</b> As soon as you're thinking clearly, tell the people you were angry at why you were angry. State your concerns and needs clearly, but try not to hurt their feelings.
        </li>
        <li><b>Identify possible solutions:</b> Work on fixing the issue that made you mad in the first place. Remind yourself that anger won't fix anything and might only make it worse.
        </li>
      </ul>
