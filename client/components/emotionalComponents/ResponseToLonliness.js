    <p>Don’t let yourself fall into the trap of believing that loneliness is forever. You might feel lonely today, this week, or even this month, but it doesn’t mean you are alone or that you have no one who cares for you. Like all feelings, loneliness is impermanent and it does not define who you are. Accept that you feel lonely, then focus on moving forward.</p>
    <h4>Here are some positive ways to deal with lonliness:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Help Others:</b> Helping others eases loneliness because it makes us be less focused on ourselves. It could be a classmate or a relative who might benefit from some time hanging out with you.
      </li>
      <li><b>Do something creative:</b> Try a coloring book or a jigsaw puzzle. Or think outside the box and come up with something that is fun and soothing for you to do
      </li>
      <li><b>Sing:</b> It’s almost impossible to feel lonely when you’re singing. I’ve tried it, and it works. Sing solo or let your favorite singer keep you company as you sing together.
      </li>
    </ul>
