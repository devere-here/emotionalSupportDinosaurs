    <p>Being nervous is never fun or easy. You may feel your heart beating fast, your palms might sweat or feel clammy, and you may even feel a little bit shaky and out of control. All you need to do to calm yourself down is to remember that everyone gets nervous from time to time and that you’re ultimately in control of your mind and body. If you have the right attitude and have some tricks to help calm you, you’ll be able to get rid of those jitters in no time at all.</p>
    <h4>Here are some positive ways to deal with nervousness:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Take a deep breath:</b> Sometimes, all you need to do to calm down a bit is to focus on the breath rising and falling from your body. Just stop what you’re doing and work on breathing in and breathing out deeply, and letting yourself take long, careful breaths instead of taking the shorter breaths people tend to take when they’re nervous.
      </li>
      <li><b>Distract yourself:</b> Though you can’t ignore your fears or worries forever, if you feel like there’s nothing you can do to address it except to worry more, then you may just want to take your mind off of it for a little while. Do something that you think will help you forget your worries and feel more at ease, such as, Reading or watching TV.
      </li>
      <li><b>Get the nervous energy out:</b> Try releasing the nervous energy you have through physical activity such as dancing, singing, or running.
      </li>
