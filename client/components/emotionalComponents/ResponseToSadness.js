    <p>It's perfectly OK to have sad feelings at times. As long as they don't happen too often or last too long, sad feelings — like all emotions — are just a natural part of life.Everyone feels sad at times.</p>
    <h4>Here are some positive ways to deal with sad feelings:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Notice how you feel and why:</b> Knowing your emotions helps you understand and accept yourself. If you feel sad, notice it — but don't dwell on it too long or give it too much drama. Show yourself a little understanding. Remind yourself that sadness will pass and you'll feel better.
      </li>
      <li><b>Bounce back from disappointments or failures:</b> When things don't go your way, don't give up! Stay in the game. There's always next time. Give yourself credit for trying.
      </li>
      <li><b>Get support:</b> Even the most capable kids need support. The people in your life who believe in you and care (like parents, friends, and teachers) can comfort you when you feel sad.
      </li>
    </ul>
